This project was to create a mini quiz app to showcase our React knowledge.
I went with a somewhat sunflower-ish styling with dark and light greens, yellows, black, and white. 

The app requirements: 
1. Have a welcome message with a page title and instructions.
2. Have user input areas for name, quiz subject, and quiz difficulty.
3. Have requirements for form submission such as not entering info, not submitting answer, etc. and display relevant error code prompts for the user.
4. Have a question display with radio buttons with the multiple choice answers
5. Inputs all must be stored in an object, and not three separate variables.
6. Have a results section which tells the user if they've answered correctly and, if not, display the correct answer. 


Bonuses: 
1. I chose to do two different error "displays" to simply exercise different options available, with one triggering an error modal. Both have the same styling (background color, text color).
2. I opted to challenge myself to do a randomized quiz category to practice more with randomzing / utilizing the Math.floor/Math.random method.
